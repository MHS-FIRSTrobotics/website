# Omega Factor  
is Mustang's FIRST competitive FRC Robotics team. We have more than a dozen students who have joined our FRC team in hopes of a successful season. Our team works to create a safe and fun environment for all students to learn about FIRST and the importance of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) careers. Together, we build a robot throughout our competitive season and practice for our first qualifier taking place in March.
